### creating a bash script:
Bash script usally contains a series of commands that we usally require to type in, cerating such a script will allow us to execute a cetain step by only executing this script file.

example code (to be typed in and saved with the .sh file extension)

#!/bin/bash

echo Hello World!

The following when executed will print hello world on the command line everytime you run this script. (look at the screensot in the LINUX folder)

## Python
### Details:
Python is a high level programming language, its designed towards being easier and powerfull. its used and applied in ML and AI task or task involving larde datasets.
We will do a series of python examples as given in PY4E website. all solution screenshot are in the folder PYTHON

## LATEX
### Details:
